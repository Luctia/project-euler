# Project Euler
**Please note: this repository may contain solutions to the problems found on Project Euler. If
you wish to solve these yourself, do not look at this repository.**

Project Euler is a collection of math problems. They are listed on
[projecteuler.net](projecteuler.net). This repository gives the software I created to solve these
problems. I only commit files that have led me to the correct solution.

If a method I create generates the problem within reasonable time, I commit it and move on to the
next problem. However, sometimes it is clear that my solution could use quite some optimalisation.
Below you will find a table listing the solutions I could improve on.

| Problem | Reason                                                   |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| 6       | Currently bruteforcing.                                  |
| 7       | Currently (almost) bruteforcing.                         |
| 9       | Better than bruteforcing, but still not quite efficient. |
| 206     | Currently "smartly" bruteforcing.                        |
