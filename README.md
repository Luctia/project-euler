# Project Euler
**Please note: this repository may contain solutions to the problems found on Project Euler. If
you wish to solve these yourself, do not look at this repository.**

Project Euler is a collection of math problems. They are listed on
[projecteuler.net](projecteuler.net). This repository gives the software I created to solve these
problems. I only commit files that have led me to the correct solution.
